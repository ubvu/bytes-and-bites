Theme: Advent of Code

We are once more approaching the winter festivities and that means two things, every other evening is a borrel and the advent of code has returned! To keep up with tradition we will work on the problems collectively and see if we can solve all 9 in our regular 2 hour session. No peeking at solutions before we try them!

Some festive foods will be served this time around!
