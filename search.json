We select a featured dataset from the TidyTuesday Data Science Learning challenge that you can analyze during the event. Ask for help if you get stuck and practice your data analysis skills.\nTalking about Pizza, how often do you wonder about science around cheese?\n\nThis week‚Äôs dataset is all about cheese: Dataset of the week\n\nThe data this week comes from cheese.com.\nCheese is nutritious food made mostly from the milk of cows but also other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, reindeer, camels and yaks. Around 4000 years ago people have started to breed animals and process their milk. That‚Äôs when the cheese was born. Explore this site to find out about different kinds of cheese from all around the world.\n248 cheeses have listed fat content.\n\nIs there a relationship between fat content and cheese type?\nWhat about texture, flavor, or aroma?"
