## What is Bytes & Bites?

Bytes & Bites is a **programming CAFE**, CAFE being an acronym for "_Code Along, Feel Empowered_". It was started in April 2023 as part of a cross institution initiative to support researchers in the domain of programming. There is no specific language focus (both human and machine), but it tends to mostly be Python and R.


>**programming cafÃ©** /noun/ - a welcoming and
>inclusive space to connect people, share knowledge
>and support researchers in their coding journeys

Bytes & Bites is a monthly meetup, usually in the O|2 building, room 01W08 on the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam campus. It is a part of the VU software community typically with VULTURE level 2 and 3 talks, workshops, and presentations, though everyone of any level is welcome.

The idea is to provide a welcoming and inclusive space to connect anyone interested in programming with other programmers to help facilitate knowledge sharing and support. We also eat pizza and chat!
